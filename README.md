Members : Hussein Rashid - Karim Abdallah
This project implements a two-player Connect Four game in C, played on a 6×7 grid through a console interface.
It can be played in 5 ways : 1) PVP , 2) Player vs Easy bot , 3) Player vs Medium Bot , 4) Player vs Hard Bot , 5) Multiplayer via network.
We used Alpine to make it run automatically at VM startup (without login).
